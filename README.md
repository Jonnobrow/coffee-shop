# â˜•Coffee Shop

This repository contains the deploy files and other useful information
for my K8s Server.

## Architecture

My cluster is a dual-stack cluster, initialized with Kubeadm on a
Ubuntu20.04LTS Virtual machine. This VM runs under Proxmox VE.

Flux is used for GitOps.

## Why Coffee Shop?

    - Espresso: Proxmox VE Server
    - Cappuccino: K8s Virtual Machine
    - Ristretto: Raspberry Pi (PiHole)
